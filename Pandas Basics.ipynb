The pricing is good, but I would recommend people to visit this restaurant for dinner than for lunch since there were many items which weren't available. We ordered a crispy chicken which was there in a big quantity even for half a plate, a chicken Maharaj which was good with those sauces. Chicken biriyani was good too. Ghee rice was good as well.\\\"), ('Rated 3.0', \\\"RATED\\\\n  I am a regular customer to mogul durbar so thought of trying this city durbar which is right next to it.\\\\nI had been here before also but never reviewed it.\\\\nI can't comment on the ambience as I ordered for a take away .\\\\nComing to the food,\\\\nI had ordered\\\\nBiryani rice\\\\nHalf grill chicken\\\\n\\\\nRice was bland could have been better.\\\\nThey didn't provide the authentic moghul sherwa, only dal and raitha.\\\\nGrill chicken was served with mayonese sauce and masala onions.\\\"), ('Rated 4.0', \\\"RATED\\\\n  Order: 5 Butter Naan, 1/2 Mutton Hyderabadi, 1/2 Barbeque Chicken, 3 Sprite (200 ml), 3 Gulab Jamun.\\\\n\\\\nBill: 580/-\\\\n\\\\nPros: Neat and clean.
